## Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now
possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity
relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the
quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements
about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in
their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people
regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but
they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal
will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and
dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts
correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is
available from the website

(see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or
by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output
will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press
*Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the
editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code
chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the
editor is displayed.
